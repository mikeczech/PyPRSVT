<b>WORK IN PROGRESS</b>

A Python package for predicting rankings of software verification tools with 
machine learning techniques including label ranking and kernels for structured data (e.g. graph kernels).

Overall task: Having a verification task v (= program + specification) and a set of 
verification tools T = {a, b, c}, predict a ranking of the tools in T s.t. it reflects 
the the tool's suitability for v w.r.t. performance and soundness.
